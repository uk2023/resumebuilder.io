# Resume Builder Capstone Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Resume Builder Capstone Project! This project showcases a dynamic and responsive resume building application built with key technologies: React, Redux, and Material UI.

## Project Highlights

- **Framework:** React
- **State Management:** Redux
- **UI Library:** Material UI

## Problem Statement

Efficient state management was a central challenge, particularly in handling states using Redux. Issues like state bloat and tracking changes across the application required strategic solutions.

## Approaches and Solutions

- **Centralized State:** Leveraged Redux to centralize the application's state, ensuring a more organized and maintainable codebase.
- **Action-Reducer Design:** Implemented actions and reducers to mitigate issues related to state mutations, achieving a predictable state flow.

## Aesthetics and Design

Material UI played a pivotal role in enhancing the project's aesthetics. The integration of Material UI components not only improved visual appeal but also contributed to a seamless and intuitive user experience.

## Conclusion

This Capstone project provided valuable insights into the complexities of frontend development, emphasizing the importance of strategic state management with Redux. The balance between functionality and design, achieved through React, Redux, and Material UI, resulted in a robust and well-designed resume builder.
